    "<h2>OBSERVATIONAL ASTROPHYSICS â€“ FALL 2021 Reduction Exercise: Part 1</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of our reduction will be to complete the following steps:\n",
    "1. make a master bias frame by combining all of our individual bias frames;\n",
    "2. subtract this frame from all of the individual dark, science, and twilight flat frames;\n",
    "3. combine your bias subtracted dark frames;\n",
    "4. subtract the dark frame from each of your science and flat field images;\n",
    "5. We may trim the images to focus on the centers where the flatfielding is good.\n",
    "6. make a combined flatfield image in each band;\n",
    "7. flatfield the individual flatfield images (as a check) and the science images;\n",
    "8. shift and align all of your science images;\n",
    "9. combine your science images to obtain a final combined science image.\n",
    "10. establish the orientation of your images and where exactly they are pointing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done we will move onto the next phase, where we measure the brightness of our objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will go through and start by viewing all of your dark, bias, and science frames to check for any issues.  You will also access the logs and you will each make your own lists of files of each type.  We will do this for the twilight flats at a later point as they were taken by Dr. Finn after we observed and I need to double check which ones we can use.\n",
